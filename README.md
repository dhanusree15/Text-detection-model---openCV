Text Detection using OpenCV and EasyOCR:
This project demonstrates text detection in images using the EasyOCR library in Python. EasyOCR is an efficient and accurate optical character recognition (OCR) tool that supports multiple languages and works well for various text detection tasks.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
EasyOCR
Matplotlib
NumPy


Usage:
Clone the repository or download the script.
Ensure you have an image containing text for detection.
Update the image_path variable in the script to point to your image file.
Run the script.
The script will detect text in the specified image and draw bounding boxes around the detected text regions.

Note:
Make sure to replace the image path with your path of the image
